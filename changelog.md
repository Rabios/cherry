# CHANGELOG

### v0.3 (9/October/2020)

- Renamed `lib` table to `package`, But you can still use `lib` as cherry is backward-compatible!

> NOTE 1: Compatibility was made from this version so it can run packages that were created with old versions of cherry.

### v0.2 (8/October/2020)

- Add possibility of folders and branching!
- Added ability to remove package installed to use in package with command `remove`.
- Renamed old `remove` command to `uninstall`.
- Improved update so it updates all other stuff source code.
- Added package file for cherry so you can also update it in same cherry directory.
- Fixed problem apps can't run in some cases!

### v0.1 (7/October/2020)

First release!
