# Working with packages in cherry

### Creating a package

To create a cherry package for example, Simply type `cherry new directory`.

Cherry will ask if your package is app, The difference is packages that serves as apps can't installed to projects/packages as libraries (Except by editing properties and this will explained in next sections).

### Installing a package to project/package

To install package to project/package, Simply type:

```
cherry get package-user/package-repo-name dir
```

> In this case, You would asked for direct installation and if so on, Input directory of installation when asked for, Else package will left downloaded in it's directory.

You can also set channel and branch, For example:

```
cherry get package-user/package-repo-name dir master github
```

> Channels available: `github`, `gitlab`, `bitbucket`, `mercurial`, Note that channels other than GitHub channel not tested yet!

### Removing a package

If a you installed package in package you made and it's valid you can remove it, Simply type `cherry remove package-name package-dir`.

Or if installed package is in folder... Use `cherry uninstall package-dir` to remove package.

### Running a package

If your package is app then simply run package by typing `cherry run package-directory`

Then package will runs if it's app from config.

> If package is not app then returns error but doesn't manipulates anything.

### Editing package properties

If you are creating or adding new files or you want to distribute your package over repository hosting website such as GitHub, You might need to edit properties of package in file named `.cherry`.

Here is what you find when you open an not edited package info:

```lua
return {
  _NAME = "package-name",
  _URL = "https://github.com/user/package-repo",
  _LICENSE = "package-license",
  _CODENAME = "package-codename",
  _AUTHOR = "package-author",
  _VERSION = "package-version-string",
  _BRANCH = "master",
  _APP = false,
  description = [[
    package-description
  ]],
  package = {
    src = {
	    "test.lua"
	  },
	  main = "test.lua",
  }
}
```
